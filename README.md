# üè≠ Capstone Project 2 ‚Äì Semiconductor Manufacturing Yield Prediction  

## üìå Project Description  
This project focuses on **predicting pass/fail yield outcomes** in a semiconductor manufacturing process using high-dimensional sensor data.  
The dataset contains readings from **591 different sensors/features** per production entity. Not all signals are equally important, so the project also aims to perform **feature selection** to identify the most relevant signals impacting yield.  

The ultimate goal is to:
- Build accurate machine learning models for yield prediction.
- Reduce dimensionality for efficiency.
- Provide insights for process improvement to increase throughput, reduce production costs, and enhance quality control.

## üõ† Procedure 

1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**  
   - Loaded `sensor-data.csv` and inspected shape, types, and missing values.  
   - Removed irrelevant columns based on domain knowledge.  
   - Filled missing values using median imputation.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Checked class balance and visualized target distribution.  
   - Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using plots and statistical summaries.  

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Split predictors (X) and target (y).  
   - Applied **SMOTE** to balance classes.  
   - Standardized features using StandardScaler.  
   - Performed train-test split and validated data consistency.  

4. **Model Training & Optimization**  
   - Trained multiple models (**Random Forest, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes**).  
   - Used **cross-validation** for performance estimation.  
   - Applied **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Compared models on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
   - Selected **Random Forest** as the final model.  
   - Saved the model using `joblib` for future use.
